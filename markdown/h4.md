#### This report is written from my personal computer using a Xubuntu 18.04.1 bootable USB and it's written using markdown.

## Computer specs

- OS: Xubuntu 18.04.1 (bootable USB, original OS Windows 10 Professional N)
- CPU: Intel i5 6600k @ 3.5GHz
- GPU: Nvidia Geforce GTX 1070
- RAM: 2x 8Gb DDR4 @ 2667MHz
- MoBo: Asus Maximus VIII Ranger (Boot menu opens with F8)

## Setting up

```bash
$ setxkbmap fi
$ sudo apt-get update
$ timedatectl set-timezone Europe/Helsinki
$ sudo apt-get install vagrant git virtualbox
```

## Assignment A) Script that turns your computer in to a minion. (21.11.2018 @ 19:00)

I started by creating a directory called scripts

```bash
$ mkdir script
$ ls
$ cd script/
```
Then I checked my ip address so that I could add it in the script that I'm going to create.

```bash
$ hostname -I
192.168.10.50 
```
What I want my script to do is to update the package repo, install salt-minion, salt-master, git and then use my IP-address to overwrite /etc/salt/minion file for me.

This is what my bash script ended up looking like.
```bash
$ nano despicable.sh
↓
#!/bin/bash

echo "Keyboard map Finnish and installing salt and git"

setxkbmap fi
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install git salt-minion 

echo "Minionizing"

echo "master: 192.168.10.50" | sudo tee /etc/salt/minion
sudo systemctl restart salt-minion
```

## Assignment C) Testing a new image with vagrant.

I started by Installing vagrant

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y  vagrant virtualbox
```

I then needed to figure out which ubuntu image I wanted to use and I checked them from here:
[Ordered from most famous to least famous VirtualBoxes](https://app.vagrantup.com/boxes/search?provider=virtualbox) 

I ended up choosing ubuntu/xenial64 which seemed legit with 3,1 million downloads and it ran 16.04 which I'm quite used to aswell.

To get the vagrant up and running:

```bash
sudo vagrant init ubuntu/xenial64
sudo vagrant up
```
It took no time at all to set up the vagrant virtual machine and all I needed to do now was connect to it:

```bash
$ sudo vagrant ssh

vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:~$ 
```

I could've edited the Vagrantfile which holds like 3 lines of code inside, but I wanted to try and test the script that I had just made on a different computer.

So I created a new folder called scripts on the vagrant computer

```bash
$ mkdir scripts
```
Then I created a new bash script called despicable

```bash
$ nano despicable.sh
```
and copied everything from the earlier script inside it and ran it:

```bash 
$ bash despicable.sh 
Keyboard map Finnish and installing salt and git
despicable.sh: line 6: setxkbmap: command not found

Minionizing
master: 192.168.10.50
```
Now the computer was set up and all I needed to do was to accept the key from my master computer.

First I checked for all the unaccepted keys:

```bash
$ sudo salt-key
Accepted Keys:
xubuntu
Denied Keys:
Unaccepted Keys:
ubuntu-xenial
Rejected Keys:
```
And accepted all the keys:

```bash
$ sudo salt-key -A
The following keys are going to be accepted:
Unaccepted Keys:
ubuntu-xenial
Proceed? [n/Y] y
Key for minion ubuntu-xenial accepted.
```

Now I tested that the script had actually done what I wanted it to do:

```bash
$ sudo salt 'ubu*' cmd.run "echo hello"
ubuntu-xenial:
    hello
```

Hello
